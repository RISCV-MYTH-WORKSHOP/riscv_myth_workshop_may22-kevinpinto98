# RISC-V_MYTH_Workshop

This repository documents all the work that was done during the course of the [RISC-V MYTH Workshop](https://github.com/stevehoover/RISC-V_MYTH_Workshop).

# Workshop Contents
* Day 1: Introduction to RISC-V ISA & GNU Compiler Toolchain
* Day 2: Introduction to ABI and Basic Verification Flow
* Day 3: Digital Logic with TL-Verilog and Makerchip
* Day 4: Basic RISC-V CPU Microarchitecture
* Day 5: Complete Pipelined RISC-V CPU Microarchitecture

# Day 1: Introduction to RISC-V ISA & GNU Compiler Toolchain
In Day 1, I have written a simple c-program to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to a given integer (n). The program is as follows:

Kindly note that I have modified the program that was presentd in the lab to take input n from the user.


**Note:** The reports for Days 2 to 5 are documented in the README.md files present in the folders of the respective days.

# Learning Outcomes
* Understanding the RISC-V ISA
* Using the RISC-V GNU Toolchain
* Syntax of TL-Verilog
* Implmentation of Combinational and Sequential Logic Circuits using TL-Verilog
* Building a pipelined RISC-V core
