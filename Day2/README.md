## Day 2: Introdution to ABI and Basic Verification Flow

* Application Binary Interface (ABI) describes a low-level interface between two applications or between an application and an operating system.

* ABI enables application programs to directly access the registers of the RISC-V architecture through system calls.

* The RISC-V architecture has 32 registers. Their ABI names as well as their usage is mentioned in the table below.
